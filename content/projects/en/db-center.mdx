## üíª DbCenter - local development made easier

DbCenter is inspired by StackBricks and dbgate. The goal is to gather database setups with a database GUI like DbBeaver or Dbgate in one place with a clean UI. It makes it easier to set up a new project and get started quickly without hassle.

## üé® Techstack used
Some of the main technologies used for the project.

<MarkdownSkills></MarkdownSkills> 

Why did i choose these technologies?

1. **Nuxt.js:** I choose Nuxt because I‚Äôve been working with Next.js for a long time and recently tried out Nuxt and Vue, so I wanted to test them on a slightly larger project.

2. **Electron:** I needed something to build the nuxt app to a desktop application and was thinking of Electron or Tauri but Tauri have some places where you use rust and that was to much to learn for this project.

3. **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was chosen to for Rapid development, and I complemented it with the ShadCn component library to streamline the user interface.

5. **Dockerode:** Dockerode was the easiest way to interact with the users docker.
5. **Pinia:** Pinia was the state management library that was closes to Zustand which i knew syntax wise.

## ‚ùì Why I built this app

I built this app because I've been curious for a while about how StackBricks works and was getting tired of the ugly UIs that usually come with database GUIs.

- [ ] Fix small bugs
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL and possibly other types of databases
