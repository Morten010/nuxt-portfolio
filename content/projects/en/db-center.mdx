## DbCenter - local development made easier

DbCenter is inspired by StackBricks and dbgate. The goal is to gather database setups with a database GUI like DbBeaver or Dbgate in one place with a clean UI. It makes it easier to set up a new project and get started quickly without hassle.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Set up MySQL database**
   - Easily set up a MySQL database with just a few clicks. The app then launches a Docker container with MySQL that you can use.

2. **Database overview**
   - In the database overview, you can see all your tables, columns with their rows, and last but not least, run SQL queries where you can add, view, or delete data.

3. **Update through app**
   - Look for new versions so the user can update when they want through the app with github releases and electron-autoupdater

## ‚ùì Why I built this app

I built this app because I've been curious for a while about how StackBricks works and was getting tired of the ugly UIs that usually come with database GUIs.

## üíª Why I chose these technologies

When deciding on the technologies for this project, I considered several key factors to ensure an efficient and effective development process:

1. **Nuxt.js**: I‚Äôve been working with Next.js for a long time and recently tried out Nuxt and Vue, so I wanted to test them on a slightly larger project.

2. **Electron**: To create a desktop application that interacts with Docker on the user's computer to run the databases.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was chosen to facilitate rapid development, and I complemented it with the ShadCn component library to streamline the user interface.

5. **Dockerode**: To interact with Docker on the user's computer.

## üöÄ Future goals for the project
- [ ] Fix small bugs
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL and possibly other types of databases
