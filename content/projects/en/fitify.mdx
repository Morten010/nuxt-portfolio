## ‚ùìWhy I Built It

In my free time, I love training. However, I found myself in need of a reliable workout app to assist me in tracking my progress, creating customized routines, and staying motivated. Unfortunately, many existing fitness apps either came with a price tag or fell short in terms of quality and functionality.

Frustrated by the limitations of available options, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a workout app.

So this project is a result of my passion for webdevelopment and weight training.

## üíª Why I Chose These Technologies

When deciding on the technologies for this project, I considered several key factors to ensure an efficient and effective development process:

1. **Next.js**: My primary interest lay in Next.js, given its versatility as a full-stack framework, making it an excellent choice for this project.

2. **NextAuth**: For authentication, I opted for NextAuth due to its ease of setup and the control it offers over user data and authentication processes.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was chosen to facilitate rapid development, and I complemented it with the ShadCn component library to streamline the user interface.

4. **TypeScript**: TypeScript was a natural choice for its type safety, industry-standard status, and its ability to save significant development time.

5. **Drizzle ORM**: I was eager to experiment with Drizzle ORM, making it a valuable addition to the tech stack.

6. **Neon DB**: For the database, I selected Neon DB because of its robust free tier and suitability for the project's needs.

These technologies were carefully chosen to ensure a robust and efficient development process while also aligning with my preferences and project requirements.
