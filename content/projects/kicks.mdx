## üíª Why I Chose These Technologies

When deciding on the technologies for this project, I considered several key factors to ensure an efficient and effective development process:

1. **Next.js**: My primary interest lies in Next.js, given its versatility as a full-stack framework, making it an excellent choice for this project.

2. **NextAuth**: For authentication, I opted for NextAuth due to its ease of setup and the control it offers over user data and authentication processes.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was chosen to facilitate rapid development, and I complemented it with the ShadCn component library to streamline the user interface.

4. **TypeScript**: TypeScript was a natural choice for its type safety, industry-standard status, and its ability to save significant development time.

5. **PlanetScale**: For the database, I selected PlanetScale because it is the best free tier out there.

6. **Prisma ORM**: I was eager to experiment with Prisma ORM, because of the easiness of reading and learning compared to other orm.
